<!-- <img src="./src/images/icon.png" style="height:50px"> -->
An android and a web application that allows you to learn and simulate very basic digital circuits and concepts of digital electronics.
The app provides you with various Integrated Circuits of logic gates which one can use to practice and understand the core logic behind our modern digital world.

The Help section within the app guides the user through the workings of the app.

E-Circuits contains 2 inputs and 3 inputs :
- AND gate 
- OR gate
- NOT gate
- NAND gate
- NOR gate
- XOR gate

Double tap on any gate to add it to your circuit.

The users can add as many gates as they want and simulate live circuits with the given inputs,outputs,Vcc(power source) and Gnd(ground).
